His view on the P vs. NP problem

> If P = NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in "creative leaps," **no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it's found.** Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss; everyone who could recognize a good investment strategy would be Warren Buffett.
